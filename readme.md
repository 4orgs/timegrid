**The problem**

Small and medium scale businesses wish to provide online service booking for their customers, but the tools out there are either *too expensive* or *too complex* for their needs.

**The Solution**

Timegrid is a single platform holding all *businesses* and *customers* while letting them an *affordable* and *easy to use* way to interact. Useful, Simple, Fast.

It is made under the [**Laravel 5.1 (LTS)**](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1) framework for [**PHP**](http://php.net/).

## How to install:

* [Step 1: Get the code](#step1)
* [Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies](#step2)
* [Step 3: Create database](#step3)
* [Step 4: Install](#step4)
* [Step 5: Start Page](#step5)
* [Optional: Populate DB with a Demo Fixture](#demosandbox)

<a name="step1"></a>
### Step 1: Get the code - Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/alariva/timegrid.git
    
If you want to stand on the latest beta-stable version:

    cd timegrid

    git checkout tags/v3.4.2-beta

-----
<a name="step2"></a>
### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies

    composer install

-----
<a name="step3"></a>
### Step 3: Create database

If you finished first three steps, now you can create database on your database server(MySQL). You must create database
with utf-8 collation(uft8_general_ci), to install and application work perfectly.
After that, copy .env.example and rename it as .env and put connection and change default database connection name, only database connection, put name database, database username and password.

-----
<a name="step4"></a>
### Step 4: Configure environment

**Copy** the **.env.example** file to **.env**

    cp .env.example .env

Set the application key

    php artisan key:generate

**Edit** all the Primary section parameters (for *local/test/development environment*)

**Change** the storage path in **.env** file to a writeable location

    STORAGE_PATH=/home/username/timegrid/storage

For **local** environment you will need to comment out APP_DOMAIN, to keep it *null*

    #APP_DOMAIN=

Back to your console, migrate database schema

    php artisan migrate

Populate database:

    php artisan db:seed
    
Update [geoip](https://github.com/Torann/laravel-geoip) database:

    php artisan geoip:update

You should be ready to go, now run the server:

    php artisan serve

Type on web browser:

    http://localhost:8000/

## Demo Sandbox Fixture

If you want to try the application with a *Lorem Ipsum* database fixture.

    php artisan db:seed --class=TestingDatabaseSeeder

Now you have two demo credentials to log in and play around.

    USER: demo@timegrid.io
    PASS: demomanager

    USER: guest@example.org
    PASS: demoguest
