**The problem**

Small and medium scale businesses wish to provide online service booking for their customers, but the tools out there are either *too expensive* or *too complex* for their needs.

**The Solution**

Timegrid is a single platform holding all *businesses* and *customers* while letting them an *affordable* and *easy to use* way to interact. Like a **CRM**, but *Simple*, *Useful*, and *Fast*.

Built with the [**Laravel 5.1 (LTS)**](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1) framework for [**PHP**](http://php.net/).

## How to install:

* [Step 1: Get the code](#step1)
* [Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies](#step2)
* [Step 3: Create database](#step3)
* [Step 4: Install](#step4)
* [Step 5: Start Page](#step5)
* [Optional: Populate DB with a Demo Fixture](#demosandbox)

<a name="step1"></a>
### Step 1: Get the code - Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/alariva/timegrid.git
    
If you want to stand on the latest beta-stable version:

    cd timegrid

    git checkout tags/v3.5.0-15120502-beta

-----
<a name="step2"></a>
### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies

    composer install

-----
<a name="step3"></a>
### Step 3: Create the database

Once you finished the first three steps, you can create the *MySQL* database server. You must create the database with `utf-8` collation (`utf8_general_ci`), for the application to work.

-----
<a name="step4"></a>
### Step 4: Configure environment

**Copy** the **.env.example** file to **.env**

    cp .env.example .env

**Edit** the `.env` file and set the database configuration among the other settings.

Set the application key

    php artisan key:generate

**Edit** all the Primary section parameters (for *local/test/development environment*)

**Change** the storage path in **.env** file to a writeable location

    STORAGE_PATH=/home/username/timegrid/storage

For **local** environment you will need to comment out APP_DOMAIN, to keep it *null*

    #APP_DOMAIN=

Back to your console, migrate database schema

    php artisan migrate

Populate database:

    php artisan db:seed
    
Update [geoip](https://github.com/Torann/laravel-geoip) database:

    php artisan geoip:update

You should be ready to go, now run the server:

    php artisan serve

Type on web browser:

    http://localhost:8000/

-----
<a name="step5"></a>
### Step 5: Start Page

Congrats! You can now register as new user and log-in.

## Demo Sandbox Fixture

If you want to try the application with a *Lorem Ipsum* database fixture.

    php artisan db:seed --class=TestingDatabaseSeeder

Now you have two demo credentials to log in and play around.

    USER: demo@timegrid.io
    PASS: demomanager

    USER: guest@example.org
    PASS: demoguest

## Troubleshooting

I'd like to [hear your feedback](https://timegrid.slack.com/messages/general/).

Let me know if you face any inconvenient to install. I'm working on bringing a more comprehensive installation guide assessing common problems.
